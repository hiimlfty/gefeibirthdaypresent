            <p>for your first gift i got you a planner! this has helped me alot to try to learn new and better habits. sometimes just telling yourself to do something isn't good enough,
              so this planner will help give you the extra boost that your brain really needs. here's what i want you to do. on every day (every box) i want you to have 3 different check
              marks to signify which of the following you did for that day. you dont have to have checkmarks you can use 4 different colors or just write down if you did it or not.
              either way, you have to tell yourself that you've done it for that day. the 4 things are the things you told me you wanted to do. did you read that day? draw a check. did you
              study for more than ___ amount of hours that day? give yourself another check. do a drawing and give yourself another check for that one. this makes it so that whenever you
              open the planner, there is tangible proof that you have done something you wanted to, and then you want to keep doing it because you want to see the book filled up. in fact,
              seeing the book not filled up will make yourself feel guilty and that can be the extra oof that will make you want to do it again. make yourself better by starting to do things
              that you make you better and not by just thinking to yourself that you will!! :)

            <p>i want to touch on mental health because you are one of the smartest and most beautiful people i know but i also know that college is stressing you out alot. i know you know this
              already but im going to say it again, its ok for you to feel anxious and scared and worried about the future, i know your grades arent the best and i know that college is difficult.
              cry if you have to, and talk to me or lily or anything about your feelings and dont be afraid to express ur emotions. u know its never good for anyone to bottle up their emotions,
              and im still mad that im not there to help u because u are in buffalo 90$ away. so dont worry, just keep studying, keep working hard. good things will come your way if you keep working,
              bitching and moaning isnt going to change anything, its action. stay mentally and physically strong with daily routines to make sure you dont break. reading the book you got for me
              for my birthday, i really regret not being able to read it with you. here's a quote from the book that i hope you take to heart. "here's the thing. future you is not going to regret
              a lack of achievement of any one thing in your life. the only thing you will regret is not trying." i wish you happy birthday and another good year!! :)
